# Why this project ? 

Everybody hates documention, and even more having to do manual menial tasks. 
And even more when you have to work with 100 different underlying components that each have their own quirks.
While the footprint of Alpine is super low (200mb), it is a bit of work to configure. 
It is also versatile, efficient and secure. 

I wanted to see how how much a single setup script can do. 

Do the standard `setup-alpine` 
> Make sure to create a user (this will be useful for later). Make the pw different from root. 

## Desktop Env 

- KDE because it's beautiful and reliable.
> Also has many essentials pre-installed and is still relatievly light (2.5GB/3GB Total)

The only prereq is git to access the script.

So `apk add git`
Then `chmod +x` and `./setup.sh` 

> Then only thing you have to do is specify the user you created in the script:
`TARGET_USER=Hill`

## What exactly: 

### Make a DE an Option not an obligation. 

This modular approach makes it so that if you create several users down the line they can all have their own configs.

## âŒ› - 10 Minutes Total

One reboot after inital `setup-alpine`,  `setup-desktop`
Then run the script.

To get to your beautiful shell/zsh: `su -l` this tells it to run as root and as a login shell :)
