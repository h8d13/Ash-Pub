# Why this project ? 

Everybody hates documention, and even more having to do manual menial tasks. 
While the footprint of Alpine is super low (200mb), it is a bit of work to configure. 
It is also versatile, efficient and secure. 

I wanted to see how how much a single setup script can do. 

Do the standard `setup-alpine` 
> Make sure to create a user (this will be useful for later). Make the pw different from root. 

## Desktop Env 

- KDE because it's beautiful and reliable.
> Also has many essentials pre-installed and is still relatievly light (5Gb Total)

So let's go! `setup-desktop` > plasma

The only prereq is git to access the script.

So `apk add git`
Then `chmod +x` and `./setup.sh` 

## What exactly: 

### From Alpine Docs

Create /etc/profile.d/profile.sh with
```
if [ -f "$HOME/.config/ash/profile" ]; then
    . "$HOME/.config/ash/profile"
fi
```
Create ~/.config/ash/profile with:
```
export ENV="$HOME/.config/ash/ashrc"
```

^^ Same for zsh and BOTH to /.config/aliases

This modular approach makes it so that if you create several users down the line they can all have their own configs.
