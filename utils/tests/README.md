# Testing

Philisophy should be to test from 100% scratch each time. Meaning from a fresh Alpine 3.21 (or whatever is Latest) 
Make smaller tests for heuristics, if pass, then test in main skripts > branch.

The key to me is actually getting perfect code. By that I mean testing until something feels perfect? 

Provided the tools used don't change too much (and staying up to date with these changes) and the code has thought of logical edge cases then the extra error handling becomes hurdles to modification and extensability. 

The philosophy of "perfect code" is personal, meaning it stems from **my use cases** ,yet is probably very similar to a lot of other people. 
Mostly dev and watching movies/youtube :D 

When I started this project it was simply a way to gain time. 
But in reality, it is much more, it's about being free, hacky way of ðŸ–• anything I used to depend on. 

That is proprietary stuff, privacy, and especially the ease of creating new stuff. 
It's also the alternative... Taking the not so common path, while staying away from easy answers or trying to convince myself of X or Y. 
That is also doing the hard part first as that solves a lot of issues later on. 

Many open-source efforts follow this same line of thought, and I love the community for it. 
But there is also pro-elitism, and a lot of it. In some people, stem a feeling of superiority because of using said or said accessbile things. 
I think to embrace somewhat of an open stance for anything new is what is most important, and also finding strengths even in things you don't like. 

I also believe it's all a big challenge, trial and error, coffee stained teeth, until something works just the way you intended it to. 

My biggest interest is that, any system is something someone thought out, sometimes amazing, sometimes totally bogus. 
And low level integration then becomes more and more essential to having what you need and having it fast.
